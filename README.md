# Hi there, I’m **Mithun Nath** 👋  

### 🚀 Mobile Engineer | AI Explorer | macOS Tinkerer  

I build **enterprise-grade iOS and Android apps**, and I’m deeply interested in **Generative AI and Agentic AI** — especially how intelligent systems can blend with real-world software engineering.

Lately, I’ve been exploring **native macOS development**, using fast prototyping techniques and “vibe coding” to ship ideas quickly.  
**Curious by nature. Builder by habit. Always learning.**
